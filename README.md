# Lenny's Brainy Memory Game



## How to Play:

* The goal is to match all the cards together and win the game.

1. Start by clicking on two cards, if they match, look for another pair of cards. If cards are not a pair, try again.

2. Keep matching up pairs until all cards are matched and faced up.

3. You must match all cards to complete the game.

4. Once the game is complete, the game grid will drop=off and show results. From here you can play again if you wish, trying to improve your score.
